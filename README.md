# Dancing Space

1. What is the proposed name for your Web application?
    - Dancing space
2. Who is the target audience for your Web application?
    - People who are interested in dancing and would like to know and watch different style of dancing.
3. What problem is it intended to solve for the target audience?
    - There's lots of dancing types like tango, waltz, samba, jazz, popping, folk dance, etc. This place is a platform for anyone who interested in dancing to search for types they prefer. It’s not only to enjoy the pictures, videos of dancing, but also share experience and ideas. For instance, beginners are able to learn other’s experience to develop their fields. I'll provide photos, videos, reviews, individualized recommendations and links.
4. How will it meet the minimum project requirements? 
    - My site will use the freemium model. Dance lovers can find pictures, videos, music, goods about different type of dance. Also users who want to share experience and ideas with others will find much fun here. Beginners who want to learn other’s experience to develop their fields and experts who want to teach and improve their dance skills will communicate with each others. 
5. Why is your proposed Web application unique or creative beyond simply meeting the minimum requirements?
    - My site will be a good resource for people users to find out a new way to enjoy dancing and share their experiences. Users can use add, delete and edit buttons to find all they needs. Also upload the file is important and useful for users. And there is no dancing web for users to not only enjoy the dance but also find goods to buy. I will track site usage, view comments frequently, sort out the most popular types of dancing. So that I can recommend popular and interesting dancing events to inactive users by sending messages.
